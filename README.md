# ModeLAB
Suite of MATLAB functions to perform modal analysis using experimentally obtained FRFs. This essentially recreates the functionality of `modalfrf` and `modalfit` in the Signal Processing toolbox.

A function called `read_signalcalc`has been included to read in ASCII files from DataPhysics SignalCalc, but this toolbox could be used with other software too with a custom defined file reader.
